Hello, random stranger reading here. I probably directed you here.
I am currently studying mechatronics engineering at Erciyes University.
I am passionate about probability, programming (mainly embedded), game theory and robotics. 
Many repos are just there so I can look back and say " wow, what an amateur I was! " so don't take them seriously.
Except for bluffjack. Take it seriously. Seriously.

Highly recommend looking at st_epl. Oh, and please ignore the ridiculous amount of commit+push for _epl repo's. It's only because I had to install a desktopless OS for the teams RPI Zero and it's a pain in the ass to edit something directly in there, no matter how small it is.

So far vast majority of code, algorithm and structure I have developed belongs entirely to me. 
In a world where immature teenagers, liars and wannabe idiots copy and paste everything from the internet, I want to learn programming concepts in a very deep level.
Before you start saying "well you gotta be comfortable working with AI", I already know that. And I do work with AI and stackoverflow sometimes, but these are the exceptions, not the rule.
That means I wrote couple of custom algorithms for my projects (I know, they are probably very inefficent but gotta start somewhere) 

And.. that's about it?
