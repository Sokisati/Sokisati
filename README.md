Hello, random stranger reading here. I probably directed you here.
I am currently studying mechatronics engineering at Erciyes University.
I am passionate about probability, programming (mainly c++), game theory and robotics. 
Many repos are just there so I can look back and say " wow, what an amateur I was! " so don't take them seriously.
Except for blackjack_real (why it's named _real is a funny story, believe me) and st_epl. Take them seriosuly. Seriously. 

Highly recommend looking at st_epl. Oh, and please ignore the ridiculous amount of commit+push for _epl repo's. It's only because I had to install a desktopless OS for the teams RPI Zero and it's a pain in the ass to edit something directly in there, no matter how small it is.

So far, around %95 of code, algorithm and structure I have developed belongs entirely to me. 
In a world where immature teenagers, liars and wannabe idiots copy and paste everything from the internet, I want to learn programming concepts in a very deep level.
Before you start saying "well you gotta be comfortable working with AI", I already know that. And I do work with AI and stackoverflow sometimes, but these are the exceptions, not the rule.
That means I wrote couple of custom algorithms for my projects (I know, they are probably very inefficent but gotta start somewhere right?). 

And that's about it. No fancy graphs, no crazy projects written by ChatGPT.
