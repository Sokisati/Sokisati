Hello, random stranger reading here. I probably directed you here.
I am currently studying mechatronics engineering at Erciyes University.
I am passionate about probability, programming (mainly c++), game theory and robotics. 
Many repos are just there so I can look back and say " wow, what an amateur I was! " so don't take them seriously.
Except for blackjack, pattern_founder and gof_calculator. Take them seriosuly. Seriously. 

So far, around %95 of code, algorithm and structure I have developed (for c++ projects) belongs entirely to me. 
In a world where immature teenagers, liars and wannabe idiots copy and paste everything from the internet, I want to learn programming concepts in a very deep level.
Before you start saying "well you gotta be comfortable working with AI", I already know that. And I do work with AI and stackoverflow sometimes, but these are the exceptions, not the rule.
That means I wrote couple of custom algorithms for my projects (I know, they are probably very inefficent but gotta start somewhere right?). 

One that I am proud of is pattern_founder. I wrote it to detect repeating patterns in game of life so I can determine whether a given cell composition will live forever or not.
gof_calculator also uses the same algorithm. (Sssh, I know it's supposed to be gol_calculator but I realized this like 2 months ago.)

Blackjack program is by far, the most sophisticated code I have ever written. 
Except for the get_combinations function, all of it are written by me. (I had a mental breakdown while writing the tree function.)
Highly suggest reading the rules and readme file before testing it though.
You can try it for yourself. Tell me how many games it took for you to beat him.
If you know a thing or two about game theory, I'd highly appreciate if you tell me what Glados (bots name) should do in parts where I had to resort to personal coefficients.

And that's about it. No fancy graphs, no crazy projects written by ChatGPT.
