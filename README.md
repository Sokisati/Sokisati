Hello, random stranger reading here. I probably directed you here.
I am currently studying mechatronics engineering at Erciyes University.
I am passionate about probability, programming (mainly c++), game theory and robotics. 
Many repos are just there so I can look back and say " wow, what an amateur I was! " so don't take them seriously.
Except for blackjack, pattern_founder and gof_calculator. Take them seriosuly. Seriously. 

So far, around %95 of code, algorithm and structure I have developed (for c++ projects) belong entirely to me. 
In a world where immature teenagers, liars and idiots copy and paste everything from the internet, I want to learn programming concepts in a very deep level.
